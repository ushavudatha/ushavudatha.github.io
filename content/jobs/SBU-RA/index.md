- Designed and built a Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for multi-region transaction banking data by consolidating 5 fragmented systems into a governed, authoritative Iceberg data layer, improving consistency and downstream trust.

- Developed SQL-based analytical layers on top of Apache Iceberg tables using Spark SQL, enabling fast, consistent querying for analytics and compliance workflows, eliminating duplicate logic across consuming teams.

- Integrated SonarQube into CI pipelines for Spark/Scala and Java services, addressing 50% and more of critical issues flagged during analysis and improving code maintainability for production data workflows.

- Leveraged Unix/Linux environments to automate and support production data workflows, using shell scripting and core utilities(grep, awk, cron, ssh) for job orchestration, operational debugging, and root-cause analysis in long-running services.
