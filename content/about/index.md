I enjoy on working with cutting-edge technologies, diving into the exciting realms of Competitive Programming, JAVA, Python. It's like unraveling a never-ending mystery, and I absolutely love it!

Currently an Associate at Goldman Sachs, building and owning large-scale, production-grade data systems in a highly regulated fintech and compliance environment. Experienced in Spark/Scala, Java, SQL, and Apache Iceberg, delivering governed, reliable pipelines processing 1M+ records daily with strong emphasis on code quality and data integrity.

I've also been recognized on a national level for my technical skills, securing top honors in esteemed technical symposiums. Oh, and let me tell you a little secret - I was crowned the top performer in [HackwithINFY'20](https://www.infosys.com/careers/hackwithinfy/2020.html), competing among an astounding 150,000 students!

I've had the honor of contributing to international publications, sharing insights that resonate globally. I believe in leaving no stone unturned when it comes to delivering high-quality results. Attention to detail is not just a habit, but a way of life for me.

By the way, did I mention that I'm not just all about code? my heart finds solace in the vibrant strokes of a paintbrush, where I express my creativity through art.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
