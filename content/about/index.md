I've also been recognized on a national level for my technical skills, securing top honors in esteemed technical symposiums. Oh, and let me tell you a little secret - I was crowned the top performer in [HackwithINFY'20](https://www.infosys.com/careers/hackwithinfy/2020.html), competing among an astounding 150,000 students!
