👩‍🎓 I graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science from [Stony Brook University](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z1MyRM8JacDd28L7LGkz8RWPvIer4mqY/view?usp=sharing)(May'23), providing me with a solid groundwork to tackle complex challenges.

👩‍💻 I worked as a Software Engineer at Sperry Technologies and as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Stony Brook University.

I'm now seeking a full-time role where I can contribute my skills in coding.

Let's code the future together!
